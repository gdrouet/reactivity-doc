= Functional foundations

`Reactivity` is built on top of a set functional foundations described here.
They define the fundamental business objects manipulated by the users and their dependencies.

== User

Obviously `Reactivity` manages the `user` who needs to create an account in order to use it.
There is no particular disposition in the definition of a `user` that differs from the common considerations encountered in softwares.

== Organization

The `organization` is a working space created by a user where the activity is managed.
The creator of an `organization` is free to invite other `users` to join it and interract with them inside that space.

== Artifact

`Artifacts` are objects created by the users to represent their activity.
A fundamental property of the artifact is the `date`, whose meaning is up to the user.

The rest of their structure is composed by a set of fields.
Some of the fields are immutable, can be mandatory and pre-defined by `Reactivity`.
Those particular fields will be mentionned inside the `Category` section.
This section will also explain how additional fields can be defined at organization level by the users to track additional activity information in the artifacts.

== Category

`Categories` are activity qualifiers.
They can be defined as a catalog of free values at `organization` level.
A `category` can be used to tag an activity and is identified as a field of the artifact, marked as optional or not by the `user`.
This offers filtering and grouping capabilities.
`Reactivity` defines built in categories with a data source based on the organization's state:

* User: the `user category` is an artifact's field optionally filled that is composed of the users associated to the current selected organization.
* Status: a `status category` is an artifact's field optionnally filled with `TODO`, `WIP` or `DONE` value.
* Interval: an `interval` allows to group the activity by `day`, `week`, `month`, `hour` or `minute`. This `category` can't be associated to an artifact but allows a `table view` to compute its `date`, as described in the `Table` section.

Following rules are defined for the `categories`:

* `User` and `Status` categories can be customized at organization level. Additional items can be added with free labels and pre-defined items can be renamed or removed.
* If the `day interval` category is used, the date of the artifact is automatically computed according to the associated day.

== View

A `view` is a representation of the activity produced over a period of time by the `users` inside an `organization`.

This fundamental object defines from when the activity of the `organization` will be viewed:

* A `start date` can be explictely defined. In that case, a `end date` can be optionally specified. If no `end date` is defined, the period covers all the activity newer than the `start date`.
* If no `start date` is defined, the *n* last `artifacts` are displayed.

Optionally the view can be also associated to a category that will be used to filter more the activity to display.
`Artifact` created in that view will be automatically associated to that category.

Many `views` can be defined inside an `organization`.
A `view` is also typed with the structure of data that is ready to consume.
Those structures have a immutable definition and are enumerated by `Reactivity` for all `organizations`.

A `view` can be marked as private by the `user` who creates it in order to not make it visible by the others.

=== List

A `list` is a basic data structure that types the view that displays the `artifacts` on several lines.
A line can be configured to display some categories and hide some other information.

=== Table

A `table` is a data structure that can type a `view`.
A `table` displays the `artifacts` in a matrix with one dimension (column) or optionally with two dimensions (columns + rows).
Columns and rows are defined with the available `categories` (`user`, `status`, `interval` and additional catalogs defined in the organization).
When the `categories` are used to list the columns or the rows, their values are automatically associated to the artifact regarding its position inside the `table`.

When the `artifact` 's fields values corresponding to the `category` used in the columns and the rows are not defined, `artifacts` are displayed outside the `table`.
A zone dedicated to that purpose is visible and is part of the `table` type.

When an `interval category` is used to define the columns or the rows, the `artifact date` is automatically computed with the associated value that has been obtained relatively to the `starting date` of the `view`.

==== Time series

`Time series` is a data structure that type a `view`.
The values correspond to the result of an operation that has counted the number of `artifacts` by grouping them with a particular `category` value.
The result of that transformation allows the `view` to let the `user` chose between different kind of chart (`line`, `pie`, `bar`, `gauge`, etc). 

== Summary

Following fundamental objects have been defined:

* `User`: people who interract with `Reactivity` to manage their activity
* `Organization`: the space where `users` manage their activity
* `Artifact`: the object that reflects the `user` activity
* `View`: the way activity is viewed by `users` and which activity of the `organization`
* `Table` or `Time series`: a data structure selected by the `view` according to its needs to display the data

A set of basic link:mockups.pdf[mockups] illustrates how the different objects can be managed through the UI.
