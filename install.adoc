== Purpose

This page describes how to install and deploy `Reactivity` in different type of environments in order to use it.

== Development

This section gives a step-by-step guide to install `Reactivity` locally.
This is for development purpose only.

=== Prerequisites

Before installing the specific components related to `Reactivity`, make sure you have installed the following tools:

* A recent version of https://git-scm.com/downloads[GIT client]
* A recent version of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java 8]
* The latest version of https://maven.apache.org[Maven 3]
* The latest LTS of https://nodejs.org/en[NodeJS] with a recent version of `npm`
* The latest version of https://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads[Couchbase 3 (community edition)]
* Your favorite IDE for `Java` and `Web` development (some configuration details will be described for `IntelliJ`)

=== Clone the repository

Core components are hosted in https://github.com/reactivity-io/reactivity[this repository].
You can https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo[fork it] and then https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository[clone it].
The branching model follows the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow[GitHub flow].
You will find for each https://github.com/reactivity-io/reactivity/issues[feature] under development a dedicated branch.

The `reactivity` repository is currently organized with the following structure:

* A `core` directory containing the backend APIs developed in `Java` with `Spring Framework`.
* A `front` directory containing the frontend web application developed in `Javascript` with `Polymer2`.

=== Build and run the backend

First we are going to launch the `backend`.
You need to build two artifacts with `maven`.
You can achieve this through your `Java` IDE which has to resolve dependencies and compile code for the two following artifacts:

* `core/java-lib`
* `core/broadcaster`

With `IntelliJ`, it's easy to import both modules with `File > New > Project From Existing Source` and then select `Maven` as the external model to be used.

Once imported, you can execute the main class `io.reactivity.core.broadcaster.Application` of the `broadcaster` project to start the server.
Make sure you have a local instance of `Couchbase` which is running.
The application will try to connect to it on its default http://docs.couchbase.com/admin/admin/Install/install-networkPorts.html[ports].

The application is launched with `Spring Boot` and uses `Netty` by default.
You can alternatively use `tomcat` by enabling the `tomcat` profile in `maven`.
By default the server listens the port `8080`, you should be able to see a test page by browsing http://localhost:8080/.

The application stores documents in the `artifact` bucket of `Couchbase` by default.
You can configure a different bucket and `Couchbase` server location with the following properties:

* `reactivity.couchbase.nodes`: a comma separated list of hosts
* `reactivity.couchbase.bucket`: the bucket name where data are stored

Those two properties can be specified in several ways and are resolved with `Spring Boot`.
You can see the different options offered by the framework https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[here].

With `IntelliJ`, a possible option is to execute the main class with the properties declared as parameter.
You can achieve this by editing the Run/Debug Configuration of the main `Application` and specifying the following information in `Program arguments`:

`--reactivity.couchbase.nodes=[my host goes here] --reactivity.couchbase.bucket=[my bucket goes here]`

NOTE: If you want to insert some random artifacts to the database, please note that the `RepositoryTest` test class can do it for you.
Simply execute the unit tests to insert some data. You will see them in the test page at http://localhost:8080/.

IMPORTANT: Please note that the unit tests currently not use the `Spring Boot` property resolution mechanism.
If you want to specify a specific value for a property, you will have to declare it as an environment variable available during test execution.
With `IntelliJ`, simply edit the Run/Debug Configuration of your unit test and specify the environment variables `REACTIVITY_COUCHBASE_NODES` and `REACTIVITY_COUCHBASE_BUCKET`.

=== Build and run the frontend web application

The frontend web application manages the dependencies with `npm` and is packaged with `gulp`.
Simply move to the `front` directory, open a command line and run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

This will install the dependencies and then start a HTTP server listening the port 3000.
You should be able to browse http://localhost:3000 at this moment.
The HTTP server is also configured to redirect traffic from http://localhost:3000/api to http://localhost:8080/.
This allows the frontend web application to naturally consume the backend application previously started.

You can refer to the `README.md` inside the `front` directory for more details.

== CloudFoundry

This section gives a step-by-step guide to install `Reactivity` on `CloudFoundry`.

The guide focuses on a deployment from your local environment.
Those steps can be automated for you regarding the continuous integration system you use.
For instance refer to https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/cloudfoundry[this documentation] for a deployment from `travis`.

=== Prerequisites

Before installing the specific components related to `Reactivity`, make sure you have installed the following tools:

* A recent version of https://git-scm.com/downloads[GIT client]
* A recent version of http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java 8]
* The latest version of https://maven.apache.org[Maven 3]
* The latest LTS of https://nodejs.org/en[NodeJS] with a recent version of `npm`
* A recent version of `CloudFoundry` https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[CLI].

=== Clone the repository

Core components are hosted in https://github.com/reactivity-io/reactivity[this repository].
You can https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo[fork it] and then https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository[clone it].
Identify the branch of the tag corresponding to the version of the code that you want to deploy and checkout it.

The `reactivity` repository is currently organized with the following structure:

* A `core` directory containing the backend APIs packaged with `maven`.
* A `front` directory containing the frontend web application packaged with `NodeJs`.

=== Prepare the manifest.yml

You have a `manifest.yml` file that you can customize according to your need.
You should have a particular attention to the routes that are configured for each module.
Adapt them according to the domains registered inside your `CloudFoundry` instance.

=== Package the application

First, move to the `core/java-lib` directory and run `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip`.
Then, move to the `core/broadcaster` directory and run the same command.
This will generate a `JAR` file in the `core/broadcaster/target` directory to be deployed.

Finally, move to the `front` directory and run `npm run dist`.
This will package the static files to be deployed in a `front/dist` directory.

Now we can upload the artifacts to `CloudFoundry`.
Use `cf login` to identify yourself with the remote server (see more details https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html[here]).

Then push the apps with `cf push` from the root directory.
This will use the `manifest.yml` and uploads the two artifacts.

=== Configure environment variables

The backend will try to connect to `Couchbase` when it starts.
You can define in `CloudFoundry` the following environment variables to specify the location of your server.

* `REACTIVITY_COUCHBASE_NODES`: a comma separated list of hosts
* `REACTIVITY_COUCHBASE_BUCKET`: the bucket name where data are stored
